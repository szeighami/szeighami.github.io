I'm a PhD student at the Computer Science Department of University of Southern California, starting Aug/2019. I obtained my BEng and MPhil degrees in computer science, both from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2017 and 2019, respectively, and was a visiting scholar at Harvard University from May/2019 to Aug/2019.
